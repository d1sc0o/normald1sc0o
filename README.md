   ☆ Hey soo before you interact with me, there's a few things you should know!
Regarding who I am: I am a fourteen year old fictionkin. I am perfectly comfortable with doubles, and I'm not super in-your-face about my kins. However, if you're uncomfy w/ doubles then hide or block me ^^ kin list will be on my strawpage for anyone who wants to see it.

I am not mentally stable. I am not diganosed with anything, and I don't claim to have anything. However, I have had some serious (non descript) mental issues before and I still do now. Also, I'm a very bad people pleaser, though I'm trying to be better about it, please be aware of that.

I'm fine with 'mean' jokes, kys/kms jokes, etc. I'm fine with slurs. I do not curse very often. Be careful with sh jokes, especially if I'm not doing well.

Never idolize mental illness, sh, or suicide around me. Sh topics can be very triggering to me so be very very careful.

I am overall a shy person. I get nervous or anxious very easily, be patient ok? Because of this i get scared to interact or contact first. Promise i don't hate you ^^ That being said, I do get very scared to approach people or talk to people. Especially when I think you're cool, and I think pretty much everyone is cool.

TO MY OOMFS!! hey you guys mean a lot to me even though we don't talk. I enjoy sitting around you guys. If i have any kind of dni in my mind, feel free to sit with me. If i don't have any dni.. still feel free to sit with me. I love looove sitting with people, it makes me very happy. Love you guys ^^
